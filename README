ReloadOnChange is a simple PHP/Javascript library that can be 
useful when developing web applications. 

The basic idea is that a page can reload itself if any files implementing the
page have changed on the server. Primarily useful for development, but could 
have other fun uses (if properly secured).  

When your page is loaded a small JavaScript snippet is executed that POSTs to 
inofity.php a list of full serverside pathnames that the script depends on. 
This request blocks until any of listed files is changed, 
and then reloads the page. 

In current incarnation it depends on Linux and inotify-tools, but in theory,
the same concept could be easily implemented on any OS that can report changes
to files. In current implementation it's useful just for development purposes,
since it uses a PHP connection for every page that is loaded in browser.


To use it, put reloadonchange.js in your javascript directory, and 
reloadonchange.php and inotify.php in your PHP project lib directory 
(or equivalent), modify paths relative paths (lib) if needed.

Optional, but recommended PECL extension 'inclued' will add dependant files 
your script has loaded so far to the list of files to be monitored for changes.
